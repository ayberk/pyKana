### yet another app to practice Kana

this application is for newbies who are trying
to learn japanese, and needs to practice hiragana & katakana. 

although it is still under-development,
you can still get it working and test some of the futures.

## todo list
* the words that are on dictionary should have categorized.
* settings diologs should have added for both romanize and vocabulary sections
* users should be able to choose both categories that they want to take quiz and the character set.
* flash cards section should be implemented. (like anka)
